A remote attacker could possibly use this flaw to disclose potentially sensitive information or cause httpd child process to crash by sending specially crafted requests to a server.

This software, such as Apache HTTP Server, is common to multiple JBoss middleware products, and is packaged under Red Hat JBoss Core Services to allow for faster distribution of updates, and for a more consistent update experience.\n\nThis release of Red Hat JBoss Core Services Apache HTTP Server 2.4.23 Service Pack 3 serves as an update to Red Hat JBoss Core Services Apache HTTP Server 2.4.23 Service Pack 2, and includes bug fixes, which are documented in the Release Notes document linked to in the References.\n\nSecurity Fix(es) :\n\n* An out-of-bounds array dereference was found in apr_time_exp_get().\nAn attacker could abuse an unvalidated usage of this function to cause a denial of service or potentially lead to data leak. (CVE-2017-12613)\n\n* It was discovered that the use of httpd's ap_get_basic_auth_pw() API function outside of the authentication phase could lead to authentication bypass. A remote attacker could possibly use this flaw to bypass required authentication if the API was used incorrectly by one of the modules used by httpd. (CVE-2017-3167)\n\n* A NULL pointer dereference flaw was found in the httpd's mod_ssl module. A remote attacker could use this flaw to cause an httpd child process to crash if another module used by httpd called a certain API function during the processing of an HTTPS request. (CVE-2017-3169)\n\n* A buffer over-read flaw was found in the httpd's mod_mime module. A user permitted to modify httpd's MIME configuration could use this flaw to cause httpd child process to crash. (CVE-2017-7679)\n\n* A use-after-free flaw was found in the way httpd handled invalid and previously unregistered HTTP methods specified in the Limit directive used in an .htaccess file.

A remote attacker could possibly use this flaw     to bypass required authentication if the API was used     incorrectly by one of the modules used by httpd.\n    (CVE-2017-3167)\n\n  - A NULL pointer dereference flaw was found in the httpd's     mod_ssl module.

This software, such as Apache HTTP Server, is common to multiple JBoss middleware products, and is packaged under Red Hat JBoss Core Services to allow for faster distribution of updates, and for a more consistent update experience.\n\nThis release of Red Hat JBoss Core Services Apache HTTP Server 2.4.23 Service Pack 2 serves as an update for Red Hat JBoss Core Services Apache HTTP Server 2.4.23 Service Pack 1, and includes bug fixes, which are documented in the Release Notes document linked to in the References.\n\nSecurity Fix(es) :\n\n* It was discovered that the httpd's mod_auth_digest module did not properly initialize memory before using it when processing certain headers related to digest authentication. A remote attacker could possibly use this flaw to disclose potentially sensitive information or cause httpd child process to crash by sending specially crafted requests to a server. (CVE-2017-9788)\n\n* It was discovered that in httpd 2.4, the internal API function ap_some_auth_required() could incorrectly indicate that a request was authenticated even when no authentication was used. An httpd module using this API function could consequently allow access that should have been denied. (CVE-2015-3185)\n\n* A flaw was found in the way the DES/3DES cipher was used as part of the TLS /SSL protocol. A man-in-the-middle attacker could use this flaw to recover some plaintext data by capturing large amounts of encrypted traffic between TLS/SSL server and client if the communication used a DES/3DES based ciphersuite.
