#                                    - LIVE - scan host no more than live_scan.min_time_gap. New hosts will be scan when
#                                             they appear in network, and next scan will be after at least

#     periodic_scan:
#       cron: <cron-like format> - This options defines how often aucote should run scans. This time is in UTC!
#                                  Examples:
#                                    "*/5 * * * *" - run every 5 minutes
