The script works by checking for the CVE-2012-0152 vulnerability. If this vulnerability is not patched, it is assumed that CVE-2012-0002 is not patched either. This script can do its check without crashing the target.

The way this works follows:

    Send one user request. The server replies with a user id (call it A) and a channel for that user.
    Send another user request. The server replies with another user id (call it B) and another channel.
    Send a channel join request with requesting user set to A and requesting channel set to B. If the server replies with a success message, we conclude that the server is vulnerable.

Much of the information provided is useful to a penetration tester, because it tells the tester what types of policies to expect.

The local users can be logged on either physically on the machine, or through a terminal services session. Connections to a SMB share are, for example, people connected to fileshares or making RPC calls. Nmap's connection will also show up, and is generally identified by the one that connected ""0 seconds ago"".

From the perspective of a penetration tester, the SMB Sessions is probably the most useful part of this program, especially because it doesn't require a high level of access. On, for example, a file server, there might be a dozen or more users connected at the same time. Based on the usernames, it might tell the tester what types of files are stored on the share.

Since the IP they're connected from and the account is revealed, the information here can also provide extra targets to test, as well as a username that's likely valid on that target. Additionally, since a strong username to ip correlation is given, it can be a boost to a social engineering attack.

Enumerating the logged in users is done by reading the remote registry (and therefore won't work against Vista, which disables it by default). Keys stored under HKEY_USERS are SIDs that represent the connected users, and those SIDs can be converted to proper names by using the lsar.LsaLookupSids function. Doing this requires any access higher than anonymous; guests, users, or administrators are all able to perform this request on Windows 2000, XP, 2003, and Vista.

Enumerating SMB connections is done using the srvsvc.netsessenum function, which returns the usernames that are logged in, when they logged in, and how long they've been idle for. The level of access required for this varies between Windows versions, but in Windows 2000 anybody (including the anonymous account) can access this, and in Windows 2003 a user or administrator account is required.

I learned the idea and technique for this from Sysinternals' tool, PsLoggedOn.exe. I (Ron Bowes) use similar function calls to what they use (although I didn't use their source), so thanks go out to them. Thanks also to Matt Gardenghi, for requesting this script.

If access to those functions is denied, a list of common share names are checked.

Finding open shares is useful to a penetration tester because there may be private files shared, or, if it's writable, it could be a good place to drop a Trojan or to infect a file that's already there. Knowing where the share is could make those kinds of tests more useful, except that determining where the share is requires administrative privileges already.

Running NetShareEnumAll will work anonymously against Windows 2000, and requires a user-level account on any other Windows version. Calling NetShareGetInfo requires an administrator account on all versions of Windows up to 2003, as well as Windows Vista and Windows 7, if UAC is turned down.

Even if NetShareEnumAll is restricted, attempting to connect to a share will always reveal its existence. So, if NetShareEnumAll fails, a pre-generated list of shares, based on a large test network, are used. If any of those succeed, they are recorded.

After a list of shares is found, the script attempts to connect to each of them anonymously, which divides them into ""anonymous"", for shares that the NULL user can connect to, or ""restricted"", for shares that require a user account.";None;netbios-ssn,netbios-ns,microsoft-ds;;intrusive;;SAMBA_ENUM

The goal of this script is to discover all user accounts that exist on a remote system. This can be helpful for administration, by seeing who has an account on a server, or for penetration testing or network footprinting, by determining which accounts exist on a system.

A penetration tester who is examining servers may wish to determine the purpose of a server. By getting a list of who has access to it, the tester might get a better idea (if financial people have accounts, it probably relates to financial information). Additionally, knowing which accounts exist on a system (or on multiple systems) allows the pen-tester to build a dictionary of possible usernames for bruteforces, such as a SMB bruteforce or a Telnet bruteforce. These accounts may be helpful for other purposes, such as using the accounts in Web applications on this or other servers.

From a pen-testers perspective, retrieving the list of users on any given server creates endless possibilities.

Users are enumerated in two different ways: using SAMR enumeration or LSA bruteforcing. By default, both are used, but they have specific advantages and disadvantages. Using both is a great default, but in certain circumstances it may be best to give preference to one.

Advantages of using SAMR enumeration:

    Stealthier (requires one packet/user account, whereas LSA uses at least 10 packets while SAMR uses half that; additionally, LSA makes a lot of noise in the Windows event log (LSA enumeration is the only script I (Ron Bowes) have been called on by the administrator of a box I was testing against).
    More information is returned (more than just the username).
    Every account will be found, since they're being enumerated with a function that's designed to enumerate users.

Advantages of using LSA bruteforcing:

    More accounts are returned (system accounts, groups, and aliases are returned, not just users).
    Requires a lower-level account to run on Windows XP and higher (a 'guest' account can be used, whereas SAMR enumeration requires a 'user' account; especially useful when only guest access is allowed, or when an account has a blank password (which effectively gives it guest access)).

SAMR enumeration is done with the QueryDisplayInfo function. If this succeeds, it will return a detailed list of users, along with descriptions, types, and full names. This can be done anonymously against Windows 2000, and with a user-level account on other Windows versions (but not with a guest-level account).

If an array of paths to check is not set, it will crawl the web server and perform the check against any
password protected resource that it finds.

The script determines if the protected URI is vulnerable by performing HTTP verb tampering and monitoring
 the status codes. First, it uses a HEAD request, then a POST request and finally a random generated string
( This last one is useful when web servers treat unknown request methods as a GET request. This is the case
 for PHP servers ).

If the table <code>paths</code> is set, it will attempt to access the given URIs. Otherwise, a web crawler
is initiated to try to find protected resources. Note that in a PHP environment with .htacess files you need to specify a 
path to a file rather than a directory to find misconfigured .htaccess files.";High;http,https,http-proxy;;auth,safe,vuln;;HTTP_INFO
