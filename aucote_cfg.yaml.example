# logging: Aucote logs a most of events in configuration files
#   file: <str> - This is path to the aucote log file
#   level: (debug|info|warning|error|critical) - This is the level of logging (default: info)
#   max_file_size: <int> - Maximum log file's size. After reach the limit, new file is created and old is archived.
#   max_files: <int> - Maximum amount of log files (with archived).
#   format: <str> - Format of log line. There are some variables which could be used:
#                   levelname - levelname of log line
#                   asctime - time of log line
#                   threadName - name of thred, which generate log line

# This section provides configurations related to aucote as a service
# service:
#   scans:
#     threads: <int> - Number of threads to be running
#     rate: <int> - Rate in packets per seconds for scanning tool (e.g. masscan)
#     period: <period> - If aucote runs in service mode it scans network every "period" time.
#                     Period should be set up in special format:
#                     <int>d<int>h<int>m<int>s, where letters mean: days, hours, minutes, seconds
#     ports: <str> - Port range in format suit to the used tool eg. T:0-65535 for nmap/masscan
#       port_period: <period> - Minimal port scanning period
#       node_period: <period> - Minimal node scanning period
