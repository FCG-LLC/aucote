nmap;ssl-poodle;SSL POODLE information leak;" The SSL protocol 3.0, as used in OpenSSL through 1.0.1i and  other products, uses nondeterministic CBC padding, which makes it easier  for man-in-the-middle attackers to obtain cleartext data via a  padding-oracle attack, aka the ""POODLE"" issue.";Medium
nmap;ssl-heartbleed;The Heartbleed Bug is a serious vulnerability in the popular OpenSSL cryptographic software library. It allows for stealing information intended to be protected by SSL/TLS encryption.;OpenSSL versions 1.0.1 and 1.0.2-beta releases (including 1.0.1f and 1.0.2-beta1) of OpenSSL are affected by the Heartbleed bug. The bug allows for reading memory of systems protected by the vulnerable OpenSSL versions and could allow for disclosure of otherwise encrypted confidential information as well as the encryption keys themselves.;High
nmap;ssl-dh-params;Diffie-Hellman Key Exchange Insufficient Group Strength;Transport Layer Security (TLS) services that use Diffie-Hellman groups of insufficient strength, especially those using one of a few commonly shared groups, may be susceptible to passive eavesdropping attacks.;High
nmap;ssl-ccs-injection;SSL/TLS MITM vulnerability (CCS Injection);"OpenSSL before 0.9.8za, 1.0.0 before 1.0.0m, and 1.0.1 before 1.0.1h does not properly restrict processing of ChangeCipherSpec messages, which allows man-in-the-middle attackers to trigger use of a zero length master key in certain OpenSSL-to-OpenSSL communications, and consequently hijack sessions or obtain sensitive information, via a crafted TLS handshake, aka the ""CCS Injection"" vulnerability.";High
nmap;http-slowloris-check;Slowloris DOS attack;Slowloris tries to keep many connections to the target web server open and hold them open as long as possible.  It accomplishes this by opening connections to the target web server and sending a partial request. By doing so, it starves the http server's resources causing Denial Of Service.;High
nmap;ftp-vsftpd-backdoor;vsFTPd version 2.3.4 backdoor;vsFTPd version 2.3.4 backdoor, this was reported on 2011-07-04.;High
nmap;distcc-cve2004-2687;distcc Daemon Command Execution;Allows executing of arbitrary commands on systems running distccd 3.1 and earlier. The vulnerability is the consequence of weak service configuration.;High
nmap;rmi-vuln-classloader;RMI registry default configuration remote code execution vulnerability; Default configuration of RMI registry allows loading classes from remote URLs which can lead to remote code executeion.;High
